									<h2><a href="#https://arcane-brook-57893.herokuapp.com/">Muralis</a></h2>
									<p>Muralis is a platform for cataloguing and reviewing urban art and public graffiti pieces. Muralis back-end was produced in Ruby on Rails, with models for maintaining the state of our application. The Model-View-Controller paradigm was used to separate the information from the model and how it is presented to the user. This is largely mediated by the controller, which is communicating the two layers. The front-end of our project was utilized using React. React was used to handle the form submits and validations. A user couldn’t submit a mural without first completing the necessary forms in a correct manner. Devise Authentication was implemented so a visitor could securely create and account and submit a mural and review as a user. Murals were stored to AWS using Carrierwave. Toastify was additionally added on to notify the user that a review or mural upload has been submitted. Foundation was used on the front-end with custom CSS. This project was stored on a PostgreSQL database.The project was then deployed to Heroku.(Project was built collaboratively, utilizing skills to create a full-stack application.)
